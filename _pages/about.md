Hi,
I'm Mauro, I live in Udine with my lovely wife and my little child Dario.

I'm an enthusiastic programmer and work as software developer at [Emaze Networks](http://emaze.net), a cutting edge company that proposes solutions oriented to the information security.

I write this blog like fun, to clarify some of the concepts I have in mind - because, as
my dear professor of mathematics, "you don't know until you don't know explain" - and, let's say, for the sheer pleasure of share and discuss with you about my little great discoveries.

Happy reading!
